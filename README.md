<h1 align="center">Hello, I am Jakub 👋</h1>
<h2>📍 About me</h2>

I am a self-taught iOS developer 📱, who creates his own creative projects. I am open to job offers 💼, where I can get my first commercial experience. My goal 🎯 is to make interesting and useful applications that will be available on AppStore. Besides programming, I love to watch NBA 🏀 and go to the gym. Now have a look at my latest projects 🤓 down below!

<br>
<h2>📲  Projects</h2>

* 🏆 My most recent app is [ParkHere](https://github.com/jakubprusgithub/parkhere), which won the competition from "Zaprogramuj Życie" discord. The topic of the competition was "reservation", which resulted in me and my friend creating an app to allow easy reservations for 🅿️arking spots.
* 🥃 My first UIKit app was [WhiskeyPlease](https://github.com/jakubprusgithub/whiskeypleaseapp), which helps users get acquainted with the world of whiskey and allows them to create a personal ranking list of degustated liquors.<br>  
* 🧩 In my free time, I like to solve coding challenges using Swift on the Codewars platform. Most of my solutions can be found in my [Codewars repository](https://github.com/JakubPrusGithub/Codewars) and more details about my [profile](https://www.codewars.com/users/JakubPrus) and rank are presented below.

* 👶 My first SwiftUI independent project was [MarvelComics](https://github.com/JakubPrusGithub/MarvelComicsApp), which presents Marvel Comics from a website using official Marvel's API.

* ⚡️ My plan for the future is to develop my first AppStore application called Energetic, which will be a community forum for the people who love energy drinks!

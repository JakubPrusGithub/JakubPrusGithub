<h1 align="center">Hello, I am Jakub 👋</h1>
<h2>📍 About me</h2>

I'm a self-taught iOS developer 📱, actively seeking job opportunities 💼. With commercial experience under my belt and several successful projects – one already available on the AppStore – I'm on a mission 🎯 to create captivating and practical applications destined to be embraced by millions! Besides programming, I love to watch NBA 🏀 and go to the gym. Now have a look at my latest projects 🤓 down below!

<br>
<h2>📲  Projects</h2>

* ☀️ I am currently working on [Tanly](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tanly-track-tanning-progress/id6450137043) - app that allows you to create your own sunbathing sessions and track your tan progress. Check it now on the App Store!
* 🌦️ My most recent and unusual project is [JustWeather](https://github.com/JakubPrusGithub/JustWeather). As the name suggests, the app simply shows the weather but with a rather unconventional design that catches the eye.
* 🏆 My best accomplishment is an app [ParkHere](https://github.com/jakubprusgithub/parkhere), which won the competition from "Zaprogramuj Życie" discord. The topic of the competition was "reservation", which resulted in me and my friend creating an app to allow easy reservations for 🅿️arking spots.
* 🥃 My first UIKit app was [WhiskeyPlease](https://github.com/jakubprusgithub/whiskeypleaseapp), that helps users get acquainted with the world of whiskey and allows them to create a personal ranking list of degustated liquors.<br>  
* 🦸‍♂️ My first SwiftUI independent project was [MarvelComics](https://github.com/JakubPrusGithub/MarvelComicsApp) and it presents Marvel Comics from a website using official Marvel's API.<br>
* 🧩 In my free time, I like to solve coding challenges using Swift on the Codewars platform. Most of my solutions can be found in my [Codewars repository](https://github.com/JakubPrusGithub/Codewars) and more details about my [Profile](https://www.codewars.com/users/JakubPrus) and rank are presented below.
